# Apple 2D

> It all started with an apple

We all have grown up studying the laws that Newton put forward, and blaming the apple that caused us so much troubles in our high schools an beyond.

As a tribute to that very apple, Apple 2D is a 2D physics library that aims to provide 2D physics support to games and simulations alike.

## What is Apple 2D ?

Apple 2D is a physics library that provides support for 2D collisions between Circles, Rectangles, AABBs (Composite shapes to come in future), Collsion Resolving, Ray casting, and [Joints].

## Why Apple 2D ?
